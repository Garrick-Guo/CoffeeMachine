# CoffeeMachine Project

## Introduction

The CoffeeMachine project is designed to help you better understand the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java. It aims to teach you core concepts such as classes, class methods, attributes, and OOP best practices. In this project, you'll have the opportunity to practice working with methods, challenge yourself with loops and conditions, and gain confidence in your OOP skills.

What could be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don't have to make yourself! With the CoffeeMachine simulator, you'll learn how to program a coffee machine to prepare your favorite coffee drinks. This virtual machine operates with typical products like coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups. When any of these items run out, the machine will display a notification. You can select from three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Plus, the machine collects the money for each cup of coffee you make!
